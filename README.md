# Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) Prediction Pipeline - Process Flow
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# AIM:
# - To develop an efficient machine learning pipeline for predicting Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs),
#   leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and advanced protein/drug embeddings.

# OBJECTIVES:
# 1. Collect, preprocess, and integrate multi-modal datasets (drug-target mappings, interaction labels, protein sequences).
# 2. Extract meaningful features from protein sequences and drug structures using AI models like ProtBERT.
# 3. Implement machine learning models to predict the likelihood of DDIs.
# 4. Evaluate model performance using robust metrics (e.g., F1 Score, Precision, Recall).
# 5. Interpret and deploy the best-performing model for real-world DDI prediction.

# DESCRIPTION:
# - WHY USE AI IN DDI PREDICTION:
#   - Drug-drug interactions can lead to severe adverse effects, making it critical to predict potential interactions before clinical trials.
#   - AI models excel at analyzing large, complex datasets, identifying hidden patterns, and learning intricate relationships between drugs and their targets.
#   - The use of deep learning models (e.g., ProtBERT) enables the encoding of rich biochemical and structural information from protein sequences, 
#     which traditional approaches cannot capture effectively.

# - BENEFITS OF AI:
#   - Automates the process of DDI prediction, reducing the time and cost associated with manual experiments.
#   - Provides better scalability and accuracy compared to rule-based or statistical methods.
#   - Offers explainable predictions that can assist pharmacologists in decision-making.

# EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
# 1. A trained machine learning model capable of predicting DDIs with high accuracy.
# 2. Reduced false positives/negatives in DDI prediction, improving patient safety.
# 3. Insights into the relationships between drug properties and interactions, aiding drug development.
# 4. A reproducible and scalable pipeline suitable for further refinement or deployment.

# INPUT FILES:
# 1. drug_targets.csv
#    - Maps drugs to their target proteins.
#    - Columns: drug_id, drug_name, protein_id, protein_name, protein_title
#
# 2. ddi_labels.csv
#    - Contains drug pairs and their interaction labels (binary).
#    - Columns: drug1, drug1_name, drug2, drug2_name, label, description
#
# 3. protein_sequences.fasta
#    - FASTA file with sequences of target proteins.
#    - Format: >protein_id followed by the amino acid sequence.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# PIPELINE STEPS:

# 1. Data Preprocessing
#    - Remove duplicate records in input files.
#    - Handle missing data (e.g., missing protein sequences or interactions).
#    - Balance class distribution in ddi_labels.csv using SMOTE.
#    - Filter and retain only relevant drugs and proteins for prediction.

# 2. Feature Engineering
#    - Protein Embeddings:
#      - Use ProtBERT (a transformer model) to encode protein sequences.
#      - Generate numerical representations (embeddings) of target proteins.
#    - Drug Embeddings:
#      - Aggregate protein embeddings for each drug based on its targets.
#      - The aggregated embedding represents the biochemical properties of the drug.
#    - Include molecular fingerprints (if structural data is available).

# 3. Drug-Target Pair Feature Creation
#    - Combine embeddings of drug pairs into feature vectors.
#    - Use concatenation or other strategies to represent interactions.

# 4. Data Splitting
#    - Divide data into training, validation, and test sets.
#      - Typical split: 70% train, 15% validation, 15% test.

# 5. Feature Scaling and Dimensionality Reduction
#    - Standardize features using StandardScaler to ensure uniform scale.
#    - Apply Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce dimensions
#      (e.g., reducing from 2048 to 200 dimensions).

# 6. Model Training
#    - Train the following machine learning models:
#      - Random Forest
#      - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)
#      - Neural Networks (e.g., feed-forward or convolutional)
#    - Use GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

# 7. Model Evaluation
#    - Evaluate models using:
#      - Accuracy: Proportion of correctly classified drug pairs.
#      - F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
#      - Precision: Fraction of true positives among positive predictions.
#      - Recall: Fraction of true positives among all actual positives.

# 8. Results Interpretation
#    - Compare models to select the best-performing approach.
#    - Perform error analysis to identify areas for improvement.
#    - Summarize key findings and select the final model for deployment.
