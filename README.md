# Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) Prediction Project

## Overview
This project predicts drug-drug interactions using machine learning models and embeddings. The dataset is sourced from DrugBank, UniProt, and NCBI, with features engineered using ProtBERT and dimensionality reduction (TruncatedSVD).

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- ProtBERT
- SMOTE
- TruncatedSVD
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)

## Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Training and Evaluation
4. Visualization and Insights
